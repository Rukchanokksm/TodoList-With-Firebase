# TodoList with Firebase Store using React.js

![Alt text](image.png)

This project is a simple TodoList application that uses Firebase Realtime Database for storing and managing tasks. The application is built using React.js and provides four main functionalities: push, read, update, and delete.

## Features

1. **Push**: The application allows users to add new tasks to the TodoList. When a new task is added, it will be stored in the Firebase Realtime Database, and the updated list will be displayed in real-time on the webpage.

2. **Read**: The application fetches task data from the Firebase Realtime Database and displays the existing tasks on the webpage when it loads. This ensures that the user can see their tasks even if they reload the page or return to the application later.

3. **Update**: Users can mark a task as completed or incomplete by clicking on it. This action updates the corresponding boolean value in the Firebase Realtime Database, and the task's appearance will change accordingly on the webpage (e.g., crossed-out when completed).

4. **Delete**: Users can delete a task from the TodoList by clicking on the "Delete" button associated with each task. This action removes the task from both the Firebase Realtime Database and the displayed list on the webpage.
